# Playpals, an educational gaming website for children aged 5 - 12 years' old

welcome to playpals! this was a final group project where we made an educational game website for children. we applied agile methodologies such as the kanban method in working on this. this was made in September 2024. 

we had a total of five group members, with me being the one spearheading the task arrangements and report writing. there is a total of 8 games in the website, split amongst 4 people. one group member was in charge of the webpage structure codes (html pages).

i did the following coding tasks:
1. developed the Flower Power game
2. developed the Learn to Type game
3. integrated both games in their respective html webpages 

to view the website, 
1. go to index.html and open in live preview
2. copy the URL from the live preview and paste on your web browser (google chrome or mozilla firefox recommended)
